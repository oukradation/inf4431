a)
when does the output data signal change, and what is the cause of this delay?

	The simulation shows that output changes after 2.5 period. As input is 
	updated asyncronously, process catches updated input at rising clock, 
	which is after 50 ns. Then there is a delay for 200 ns, 2 period, which 
	is caused by internal signals which are assigned between input and output.

b)
why is the output data equal to "UUUUUUUU" at time 50 ns?

	UUUUUUUU is caused since rst_n starts with '1'. In the architecture, we only
	initialize indata and outdata when reset is '0'.
	
c)
Why is output(7 downto 6) always equal to output(3 downto 2)? Why is output(5 downto 4)
 different from output(1 downto 0)?

	signal is updated when process is done. This indicates that line 20,21
	'''
	  sig1 <= var1;
          sig2 <= var2;
	'''
	doesn't do anything as sig2 and sig1 is updated afterwards.
	
	However, when variables are assigned, it has immediate effect. So output(5,4) 
	and output(1,0) will be different.
	
d)
Why does output(7 downto 6) and output(3 downto 2) have different values than in 
exercise c)?

	When the signal is in the sensitivity list, the process is triggered again after 
        first round of process is done ( signal is changed ). Initial state of the signal is 
        unknown and it receives a known value from assignment of variable.
